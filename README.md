ImmunoHack: TILs – Advancing Breast Cancer Insights
🚀 Unlocking the Power of Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) for Breast Cancer Analysis

🔬 Project Overview
ImmunoHack: TILs focuses on developing cutting-edge computational models to analyze histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs) of breast cancer tissues. The goal is to detect, segment, and quantify TILs, which serve as crucial biomarkers for prognosis and treatment response.

🎯 Key Objectives
✅ TILs Detection: Using YOLOv8 for accurate identification of lymphocytes and plasma cells.
✅ Tumor & Stroma Segmentation: Leveraging Efficient-UNet to differentiate invasive tumors and their microenvironment.
✅ Automated TILs Score Calculation: Quantifying immune infiltration to support prognosis and immunotherapy decisions.

🏥 Why It Matters
TILs are essential in breast cancer prognosis and treatment planning. Their density correlates with:
🔹 Better survival rates in high-TIL patients
🔹 Enhanced response to immunotherapy and chemotherapy
🔹 Improved precision oncology strategies

🛠 Methodology
Patch-Based Image Processing (512x512 patches to retain histological details)
Color Normalization to correct staining variations
Multi-Scale Object Detection using YOLOv8
Deep Learning Segmentation via Efficient-UNet
Quantitative TILs Score Calculation for clinical insights
📊 Evaluation Metrics
📌 IoU (Intersection-over-Union) – Segmentation accuracy
📌 Average Precision (AP) – Cell detection performance
📌 TILs Score Correlation – Validation with pathologist assessments

📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of high-resolution H&E-stained WSIs, annotated with:

Lymphocyte & Plasma Cell Locations (COCO format)
Tumor & Stroma Segmentation Masks (7 distinct tissue labels)
